<h1>Building Fandangled</h1>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>The 'too long; didn't read' version for the incurrably impatient</p>

<p>You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the <a href="https://github.com/andyhedges/Fandangled/zipball/v0.0.2"/>source code</a>, we'll assume you use wget to download but you can use your browser if you prefer</li>
<li>A tool to unzip that, we'll assume gnu zip</li>
<li>A JDK 1.6 or higher</li>
<li>Maven 2 (haven't tried 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>To build run the following commands</p>
<code>
$ wget -O fandangled.zip --no-check-certificate https://github.com/andyhedges/Fandangled/zipball/v0.0.2
$ unzip fandangled.zip
$ cd andyhedges-Fandangled-29a1926
$ mvn clean install
</code>

<p>Once maven has finished you should have a compiled set of jar files</p>

<p>Unless you are a library user you will be interested in either of the two executable files, one is a gui the other is command line.
The commandline is at the following path:</p>

<code>
command-line/target/command-line-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
</code>

<p>The gui is at the following path</p>

<code>
basic-gui/target/basic-gui-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
</code>

<p>I recommend you use the command line, the GUI was a bit of an experiement and gui design isn't my strength. If you fancy writing a better one
please get in touch (tmp1@hedges.net put 'Fandangled' in the subject line somewhere)</p>
