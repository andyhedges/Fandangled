    <h1>The Fandangle Interface Definition Language (FIDL) Specification</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>The purpose of the Fandangled framework of which the IDL plays a central role is to enable Service analysts to
        specify service interfaces without the need to detail the technical implementation details of that service. This
        way
        business owners can ensure that a service interface exposes the functionality and data they require without
        having
        to detail or indeed understand the technical detail of how the service is exposed.</p>

    <p>Service implementors can then take that service interface defintion (an IDL file) and convert it to the technical
        implementation using either a provided codec or one that they have created themselves. Codecs in Fandangled are
        always one way and so perhaps they should be called encoders, notwithstanding, their purpose is to translate
        from
        IDL to a technical implementation.</p>

    <p>
        At the time of writing there exists the following codecs:
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Word Documents in Open Office XML format (usually refered to as docx)</li>
        <li>Web Services Description Language (WSDL sometimes pronounced wiz-dul)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently in planning or early development are codec for:
    <ul>
        <li>Representational State Transfer (REST)</li>
        <li>Java Messaging Service (JMS)</li>
        <li>An efficient binary protocol</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This document aims to explain the format of the IDL and explain what each format element means at a sematic
        level</p>

    <h2>File Format</h2>

    <p>The file format is a text document, created by any modern text editor such as Notepad, Textpad, vi or gedit. We
        recommend UTF-8 for the character encoding but ISO-8859-1 and other encoding will work equally well.</p>

    <p>The style of the interface definition is very similar to a Java or C# interface however with an emphasis on
        documentation and business functionality rather than details of scoping and other coding concerns.</p>

    <h3>Attributes</h3>

    <p>Most information is tagged with attribute names and each attribute definition is terminated with a semi-colon. An
        attribute will look somehting like:</p>

    <code>@something string, "some free text in inverted commas";</code>

    <p>The attribute name is preceeded with the '@' symobol and conforms to the format of an ID (see below)</p>

    <h3>Attibute Properties</h3>

    <p>An attribute has a number of properties and each property is either an ID, a free text field or a version number

    <p>

    <h4>IDs</h4>

    <p>An ID is a string that must start with a letter or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters numbers or
        underscores. All letters must be unaccented latin characters.</p>

    <h4>Free Text Fields</h4>

    <p>Free text fields are surrounded by double quotes and can contain any character sequence including new line
        indicators. In order to have a literal double quote in a free text field it must be delimited with a backslash.
        The
        following is a simple example:</p>

    <code>"This is a simple example"</code>

    <p>A more complex example might be</p>

    <code>
        "Is this a multiline example with a double quotes in it&#8253;<br/><br/>

        Yes, it is. What I really need is an accented word like \"na&#239;vet&#233;\" to demonstrate accents"
    </code>

    <h4>Version numbers</h4>

    <p>Version numbers in Fandanged are dot separated numbers, they should be strictly increasing with the left being
        the
        most significant part. A simple example of a version number is:</p>

    <code>1.12.10</code>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>

    <p>The preamble defines a number of peice of information. Let's look at a barebones IDL file to get a feel for the
        structure of the preamble</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface InterfaceName exposes ServiceName{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    @version 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h4>Version of Fandangled IDL</h4>

    <p>All FIDLs should start with the version of FIDL specification they conform to, in this case 0.0.1, the attribute
        name
        for this information is fandangled
    </p>

    <code><strong>@fandangled 0.0.1; </strong>
interface InterfaceName exposes ServiceName{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    @version 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <p>The FIDL version must appear as the first non whitespace in the file</p>

    <h4>Interface Name</h4>

    <p>The interface name in this case 'InterfaceName' is whatever you wish to call the service interface, it must be a
        valid ID</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface <strong>InterfaceName</strong> exposes ServiceName{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    @version 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h4>Service Name</h4>

    <p>The service name is the name of the service on which this interface exposes data and functionality. In future
        this
        will cause types, enumerations and exception to be imported into the interface, for now it is just a marker</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface InterfaceName exposes <strong>ServiceName</strong>{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    @version 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h4>Owner</h4>

    <p>This is the name and email address of the person accountable for the interface. We strongly recommend this is an
        individual rather than a role. There can only be one owner.</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface InterfaceName exposes ServiceName{
    <strong>@owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com"; </strong>
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    @version 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h4>Author</h4>

    <p>This is the name and email address of the author of the interface. This annotation can be repeated multiple times
        in
        the case that multiple people have worked on the interface definition</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface InterfaceName exposes ServiceName{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    <strong>@author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";</strong>
    @version 0.0.1;
 }</code>

    <h4>Version of the Interace</h4>

    <p>This is the version of this particular interface, this is reference by the <var>@since</var> attributes of many of the other
        structures in the file</p>

    <code>@fandangled 0.0.1;
interface InterfaceName exposes ServiceName{
    @owner "John Smith", "john.smith@uk.example.com";
    @author "Simon Jones", "simon.jones@us.example.com";
    @author "Susan Papadopoulos", "susan.papadopoulos@example.org";
    <strong>@version 0.0.1;</strong>
}</code>


    <h3>Operations</h3>

    <p>Operations represent callable behaviour on the service interface. An operation takes a set of parameters as a
    request and returns a single parameter of a specified type if things go to plan. Otherwise it will return a single
    exception. Here follows an example of an operation in FIDL:</p>

<code>Money currencyConvert(mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency) throws ExchangeRateOutOfDateException {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";
	@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";
	@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";
	@since 0.0.1;
}
</code>

    <h4>Return</h4>
    <p>The return type of the operation is defined at the start of the method signature. In this case it is a <var>Money</var>
        type.</p>

    <p>A description of the return type is provided in the body of the operation against the <var>@return</var> attribute</p>

<code><strong>Money</strong> currencyConvert(mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency) throws ExchangeRateOutOfDateException {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	<strong>@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";</strong>
	@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";
	@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";
	@since 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h4>Operation Name</h4>
    <p>This is simply the operation name</p>


    <code>Money <strong>currencyConvert</strong>(mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency) throws ExchangeRateOutOfDateException {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";
	@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";
	@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";
	@since 0.0.1;
}
</code>

    <h4>Parameters</h4>

    <p>Parameters are defined after the operation name in brackets. A parameter consists of the an optional keyword
        <var>mandatory</var> meaning that the caller should always specify a value for it. Following this the
    parameters type is defined followed by a name for that parameter. More than one parameter definition can be
    specified for an operation, they are simply separated by commas.</p>

    <p>For each parameter a <var>@parameter</var> attribute it defined in the body of the operation. This allows for the
    parameter to be documented</p>

<code>Money currencyConvert(<strong>mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency</strong>) throws ExchangeRateOutOfDateException {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";
	<strong>@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";</strong>
	@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";
	@since 0.0.1;
}
</code>

    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
    <p>Exceptions are returned from operations when there the operation cannot be completed correctly for whatever
        reason. The exception types that the operation can return are defined after the <var>throws</var> keyword.
    More than one exception can be specified by providing a comma separated list.</p>

    <p>The reason why the operation would throw this kind of exception is specified in the @exception attribute. The
    format first specifies the exception type followed by the description.</p>

    <code>Money currencyConvert(mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency) throws <strong>ExchangeRateOutOfDateException</strong> {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";
	@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";
	<strong>@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";</strong>
	@since 0.0.1;
}
</code>

    <h4>Since</h4>

    <p>The <var>@since</var> atrribute specifies the version of the interface that the operation was introduced in.
    Authors should be clear that any breaking amendment to the operation must require an update to the <var>@since</var>
    field. So for example in a new parameter is added to an operation then the <var>@since</var> attribute should be update to the
    version of the interface where that parameter was added. It must not be left at the value that an operation with the
    same name as added.</p>

<code>Money currencyConvert(mandatory Money sourceAmount, Currency currency) throws ExchangeRateOutOfDateException {
	@description "Converts a given amount of money into the equivalent amount according to the current exchange rates
                    available";
	@return "the equivalent amount in the required currency";
	@parameter sourceAmount, "The amount of money to convert";
	@parameter currency, "the currency to convert the amount to, if not specified USD will be assumed";
	@exception ExchangeRateOutOfDateException, "If the exchange rate for the currencies required are not up to date
                                                    enough the conversion cannot be calculated";
	<strong>@since 0.0.1;</strong>
}
</code>
    <h3>Types, Events and Exceptions</h3>

    <p>Types, Events and Exceptions all follow exactly the same structure. The only difference being the keyword they
    are proceeded by (i.e type, event or exception). The rest of the structure of type is the same as operations only
    a type cannot throw an exception or have a return.</p>

<code>type Person (mandatory string firstname, mandatory string lastname, mandatory Gender gender, string email,
    datetime dateOfBirth){
	@description "Represents basic information on a person";
	@parameter firstname, "The persons firsname.";
	@parameter lastname, "The persons lastname (i.e. surname).";
	@parameter gender, "the gendered of the person";
	@parameter email, "the persons SMTP email address";
	@since 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h3>Enumerations</h3>
    <p>Enumerations are used to provide a list of values that a certain property should be constrained to. They are
    mostly self explanatory. They have a description just like operations and types, the possible values are listed in
    brackets, however they don't need to specify the type or whether they are mandatory. Each value can be documented
    (or not, quite often they are obvious) in the body of the enumeration using the <var>@value</var> attribute.</p>

<code>enumeration Day(MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY){
    @description "Gregorian days of the week.";
    @value MONDAY, "blue";
    @value TUESDAY, "gray";
    @value WEDNESDAY, "gray too";
    @value THURSDAY, "don't care";
    @value FRIDAY, "I'm in love";
    //Not documenting the rest because it's isn't required and there aren't song lyrics for them
    @since 0.0.1;
}</code>

    <h3>Primitive Types</h3>
    <p>FIDL has a number of build in primative types. These are as follows:</p>


    <dl>
        <dt>string</dt><dd>A piece of text; a sequence of characters</dd>
        <dt>boolean</dt><dd>true or false</dd>
        <dt>byte</dt><dd>an 8-bit signed integer</dd>
        <dt>short</dt><dd>a 16-bit signed integer</dd>
        <dt>int</dt><dd>a 32-bit signed integer</dd>
        <dt>long</dt><dd>a 64-bit signed integer</dd>
        <dt>float</dt><dd>a 32-bit signed decimal</dd>
        <dt>double</dt><dd>a 64-bit signed decimal</dd>
        <dt>datetime</dt><dd>a point in time irrespective of timezone with millisecond granularity</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Primitive Collections</h3>
    <p>The are 3 collection types that can be used in FIDL. The are parametrized by the types that can contain. The
    parameterization is specified in chevrons after that declation. There
    3 types are as follows:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>list</dt>
        <dd>a collection that can contain multiple copies of the same instance (e.g. <var>list&lt;Person&gt;</var>)</dd>
        <dt>set</dt>
        <dd>a collection that can not contain multiple copies of the same instance (e.g. <var>set&lt;Person&gt;</var>)</dd>
        <dt>map</dt>
        <dd>an associative array or dictionary (e.g. <var>map&lt;string, Person&gt;</var>)</dd>
    </dl>
